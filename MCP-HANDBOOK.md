## Installation & Transport Options

### HTTP vs STDIO

MARM MCP Server supports two transport modes for different deployment scenarios:

**HTTP Transport** (Default)
- Traditional server-client architecture
- Best for: Multiple concurrent AI clients, cloud/remote deployment, shared memory server
- Setup: Run `marm-mcp-server` and connect via `http://localhost:8001/mcp`

**STDIO Transport** (Process-based)
- Direct stdin/stdout communication
- Best for: CLI tools, orchestration platforms, Cursor IDE, single AI client per process
- Setup: Run `python server_stdio.py` via MCP client configuration
- Advantage: No port management, process isolation per connection

### Quick Start Guide

**Docker (HTTP - Fastest):**

```bash
docker pull lyellr88/marm-mcp-server:latest
docker run -d --name marm-mcp-server -p 8001:8001 -v ~/.marm:/home/marm/.marm lyellr88/marm-mcp-server:latest
claude mcp add --transport http marm-memory http://localhost:8001/mcp
```

**Local HTTP:**

```bash
pip install marm-mcp-server==2.2.6
pip install -r marm-mcp-server/requirements.txt
python marm-mcp-server
claude mcp add --transport http marm-memory http://localhost:8001/mcp
```

**STDIO:**

```bash
pip install marm-mcp-server==2.2.6
pip install -r marm-mcp-server/requirements_stdio.txt
<platform> mcp add --transport stdio marm-memory-stdio python "your/file/path/to/marm-mcp-server/server_stdio.py"
python marm-mcp-server/server_stdio.py
```

Replace `<platform>` with: `qwen`, `claude`, or `gemini` depending on your AI CLI tool.

**For complete installation instructions, platform-specific configurations, JSON setup, troubleshooting, and detailed transport comparison, see the [README.md Quick Start section](https://github.com/Lyellr88/MARM-Systems/blob/MARM-main/README.md#-quick-start-for-mcp).**

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **SQLite3**: Included with Python (no separate install needed)
- **Storage**: ~100MB minimum for initial setup, scales with memory database size
- **RAM**: 512MB minimum (varies by concurrent clients and database size)
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux

### Data Location & Backup

All MARM data is stored locally in your home directory:

- **Location**: `~/.marm/` (Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.marm\` (Windows)
- **Contents**: SQLite database with all memories, sessions, and notebooks
- **Backup**: Copy the entire `~/.marm/` directory to preserve all data
- **Privacy**: Everything stays on your machine — no cloud sync or external storage

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify MARM is working correctly:

```bash
# HTTP - Check server is running
curl http://localhost:8001/mcp/health

# Or use the MARM system info tool (once connected to your AI client)
# Ask your AI: "Check MARM system status" - it will call marm_system_info
```

Expected output includes:
- Server version (2.2.6)
- Database size in MB
- Total memories and sessions count
- Feature availability (semantic search status)

---

## Getting Started

### 💡 **Key Point: Natural Language Interface**

**You don't need to manually call MARM tools!** Just talk to your AI agent naturally:

- *"Claude, log this session as 'Project Alpha'"*
- *"Remember this code snippet for later"*
- *"Search for what we discussed about authentication"*
- *"Add this debugging approach to my notebook"*

Your AI agent will automatically use the appropriate MARM tools. Manual tool access is available for power users, but most users should just **talk naturally** and let the AI handle the tool usage.

### What is MARM?

MARM is a **Universal MCP Server** providing intelligent memory that saves across sessions for AI conversations with:

- **Semantic Search** - Find memories by meaning, not keywords
- **Cross-App Memory** - Share memories between AI clients (Claude, Qwen, Gemini)
- **Auto-Classification** - Content automatically categorized for intelligent recall
- **Session Management** - Organize conversations with structured logging

### Core Concepts

**Sessions**: Named containers for organizing memories
**Memories**: Stored content with semantic embeddings for intelligent search
**Notebooks**: Reusable instructions and knowledge snippets
**Logging**: Structured conversation history with timestamps

### Example Workflow: Cross-AI Research Project

Here's a realistic workflow showing MARM in action:

**Scenario:** You're researching authentication patterns for a new project using multiple AI clients.

**Phase 1: Start Session (Claude)**
```
You: "Claude, activate MARM and create a session called 'auth-research-2025-01'"
Claude calls: marm_start("auth-research-2025-01")
Claude calls: marm_log_session("auth-research-2025-01")
Result: Session created, MARM active for this conversation
```

**Phase 2: Capture Research (Claude)**
```
You: "Summarize OAuth2 vs JWT for API authentication and save it"
Claude calls: marm_contextual_log("OAuth2 is token-based with refresh cycles, better for delegated access. JWT is stateless, good for microservices...")
Result: Memory stored with auto-classification as "code" content
```

**Phase 3: Add Reusable Reference (Claude)**
```
You: "Save a JWT validation code snippet to my notebooks as 'jwt-validation-pattern'"
Claude calls: marm_notebook_add("jwt-validation-pattern", "def verify_jwt(token):\n  # validation logic...")
Result: Reusable snippet stored for future projects
```

**Phase 4: Recall Context (Gemini)**
```
You: "Gemini, what authentication approaches did we research? Activate the JWT pattern."
Gemini calls: marm_smart_recall("authentication patterns", search_all=true)
Gemini calls: marm_notebook_use("jwt-validation-pattern")
Result: Gemini sees previous research + has JWT code available as context
```

**Phase 5: Synthesis & Summary (Qwen)**
```
You: "Qwen, pull everything from the auth research and create a summary"
Qwen calls: marm_smart_recall("authentication", session="auth-research-2025-01", limit=20)
Qwen calls: marm_summary("auth-research-2025-01")
Result: Qwen generates implementation guide from all captured research
```

**Phase 6: End Session (Claude)**
```
You: "Log final decision - we're using JWT for APIs and OAuth2 for user auth"
Claude calls: marm_log_entry("DECISION: JWT for API auth, OAuth2 for user flows. Rationale: stateless APIs + delegated user access", session="auth-research-2025-01")
Result: Decision logged and searchable by all future AI clients
```

**Result**: Three different AI clients collaboratively researched a topic, shared insights, and documented decisions—all without re-explaining the project to each new AI.

## Understanding MARM Memory

### How Memory Works

MARM uses **semantic embeddings** to understand content meaning, not exact word matches:

```txt
User: "I discussed machine learning algorithms yesterday"
MARM Search: Finds related memories about "ML models", "neural networks", "AI training"
```

### Memory Types

1. **Contextual Logs** - Auto-classified conversation memories
2. **Manual Entries** - Explicitly saved important information  
3. **Notebook Entries** - Reusable instructions and knowledge
4. **Session Summaries** - Compressed conversation history

### Content Classification

MARM automatically categorizes content:

- **Code** - Programming snippets and technical discussions
- **Project** - Work-related conversations and planning
- **Book** - Literature, learning materials, research
- **General** - Casual conversations and miscellaneous topics

### Revolutionary Multi-AI Memory System

- **Beyond Single-AI Memory:** Unified memory layer that saves data, accessible by *any* connected LLM that supports MCP
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence:** Different AIs learn from each other's interactions and contribute to a shared knowledge base
- **User-Controlled Hybrid Memory:** Granular control over memory sharing and ability to import existing chat logs

---

## Adding Content to MARM Memory

MARM provides three primary ways to store information:

**`marm_contextual_log`** - General-Purpose "Smart" Memory

- Auto-classifying memory storage with embeddings
- Best for: Key decisions, solutions, important insights

**`marm_log_entry`** - Structured Chronological Milestones

- Auto-formatted with timestamps (no manual date needed)
- Best for: Daily logs, progress tracking, milestones, decisions

**`marm_notebook_add`** - Reusable Instructions

- Store reusable instructions and knowledge
- Best for: Code snippets, style guides, procedures

---

## Cross-App Memory Strategies

### Multi-LLM Session Organization

**Strategy**: Use LLM-specific session names to track contributions:

```txt
Sessions:
- claude-code-review-2025-01
- qwen-research-analysis-2025-01  
- gemini-creative-writing-2025-01
- cross-ai-project-planning-2025-01
```

### Memory Sharing Workflow

1. **Individual Sessions**: Each AI works in named sessions
2. **Cross-Pollination**: Use `marm_smart_recall` to find relevant insights
3. **Synthesis Sessions**: Create shared sessions where AIs build on each other's work

---

## Pro Tips & Best Practices

### Memory Management Tips

**Log Compaction**: Use `marm_summary`, delete entries, replace with summary
**Session Naming**: Include LLM name for cross-referencing
**Strategic Logging**: Focus on key decisions, solutions, discoveries, configurations

### Search Strategies

**Global Search**: Use `search_all=True` to search across all sessions
**Natural Language Search**: "authentication problems with JWT tokens" vs "auth error"
**Temporal Search**: Include timeframes in queries

### Workflow Optimization

**Notebook Stacking**: Combine multiple entries for complex workflows
**Session Lifecycle**: Start → Work → Reference → End with compaction

<summary><b>🔧 Troubleshooting Guide (Click to expand)</b></summary>

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Server Issues

**Server won't start**
- Check Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.10+)
- Verify port 8001 isn't in use: `lsof -i :8001` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8001` (Windows)
- Check for permission errors in home directory (`~/.marm/` must be readable/writable)
- See platform-specific troubleshooting: [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](https://github.com/Lyellr88/MARM-Systems/blob/MARM-main/docs/INSTALL-DOCKER.md), [INSTALL-WINDOWS.md](https://github.com/Lyellr88/MARM-Systems/blob/MARM-main/docs/INSTALL-WINDOWS.md), [INSTALL-LINUX.md](https://github.com/Lyellr88/MARM-Systems/blob/MARM-main/docs/INSTALL-LINUX.md)

**STDIO connection fails**
- Ensure `cwd` parameter points to the marm-mcp-server directory
- Verify `server_stdio.py` file exists and is executable
- Check AI client documentation for STDIO transport requirements
- Try direct execution: `python server_stdio.py` to see error messages

### Connection & Integration

**AI client can't connect to MARM**
- Verify server is running: `curl http://localhost:8001/mcp/health`
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 8001
- For STDIO: ensure path to `server_stdio.py` is absolute (not relative)
- Restart both server and AI client

**Tools not appearing in AI client**
- Run `marm_system_info` to verify server loaded correctly
- Check server logs for initialization errors
- Disconnect and reconnect AI client to refresh tool list

### Memory & Data Issues

**Memories not saving**
- Verify `~/.marm/` directory exists and has write permissions
- Check available disk space
- Test with simple memory: ask AI to save a single line and check with `marm_log_show`
- Run `marm_system_info` to check database status

**Search returns no results**
- Verify memories exist: use `marm_log_show` to list entries
- Use `search_all=true` to search across all sessions
- Try simpler, more general search queries
- Wait a few seconds—first semantic search loads the ML model

**Memories appear then disappear**
- Check if MARM was restarted or crashed (data persists in `~/.marm/`)
- Verify disk space didn't fill up
- Check system logs for database errors

### Performance

**Slow search results**
- First search is slower (model loads from disk)—subsequent searches are faster
- Large databases (1000+ memories) may take a few seconds
- Limit searches: use `limit=10` instead of unlimited results
- Use `marm_summary` to compress old sessions

**Server using too much memory**
- Notebooks with many entries can accumulate—use `marm_notebook_clear` to prune
- Close unused AI client connections
- Use log compaction: `marm_summary` + delete old entries

### Data Recovery

**Lost or corrupted data**
- Stop the server immediately
- Check `~/.marm/` directory for backup copies (if you created them)
- Restore from backup: copy your backup `~/.marm/` back to home directory
- Restart server

**Database locked error**
- Close all AI client connections
- Stop the server: `Ctrl+C`
- Remove lock file if present: `rm ~/.marm/marm_usage_analytics.db-wal` (Linux/macOS)
- Restart server

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `address already in use` | Port 8001 occupied | Kill process on 8001 or use different port |
| `permission denied: ~/.marm/` | Database directory not writable | `chmod 755 ~/.marm/` or check ownership |
| `module not found: core.memory` | Missing dependencies | Reinstall: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `requirements_stdio.txt` |
| `database is locked` | Multiple processes accessing DB | Close other connections, restart server |
| `embedding model not found` | Semantic search model didn't download | First run takes time—be patient, check internet connection |
